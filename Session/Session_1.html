        Building a website begins with mastering the foundation—HTML, the language that structures content on the web.
        <br />
        With tags like headings and paragraphs, developers organize information clearly and efficiently. When paired with
        CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML transforms static pages into dynamic user experiences.
        Tools like Visual Studio Code make development smoother, especially when boosted by extensions like Live Server,
        Prettier, and Path Intellisense. These help streamline workflows, fix code instantly, and reduce common errors—
        making web design not just faster but way more fun.
